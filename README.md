# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ismail Lamraoui!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate and curious engineering student at ENSA Oujda (Morocco), exploring the world of software development, data, and technology-driven impact.

## 💻 What I'm Working On

- 🔬 **Blood Donation Awareness Website**  
  A dynamic, educational platform to raise awareness and provide resources about blood donation in Morocco. Currently built with HTML & CSS — working on adding responsiveness, JavaScript interactions, and possibly user forms.

- 🏫 **JavaFX Projects**  
  - A **School Management System** and a **Medical App** using JavaFX, MVC architecture, and MySQL.
  - Practicing clean architecture, UML modeling, and gradual project improvements.

- 🧠 **Python for Data**  
  Focused on object-oriented design, `NumPy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. Learning by building, not just watching tutorials.

## 🧩 Fun Facts

- I love learning through **hands-on building**, **competitions**, and helping others grasp tough concepts.
- Big fan of mixing **tech** with **real-world impact** — like awareness platforms and educational games.
- I also design quiz games (like image-based guessing about historical/political figures).
